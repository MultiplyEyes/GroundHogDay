### movie description

I have watched the groundhog day movie, its about a newsreporter named Phill going to a small town that celebrate Groundhog day.
Phil hates this town and want to leave as soon as possible. After being forced to stay in town because of a blizzard.
Phil wakes up again on groundhog day. Now he stuck in an timeloop to repeat the sameday over and over again.

## Design concept

Current concept of the website is an old clock that appears in the movie. The clock has design of flipping though pages. 
But the website version of the clock has the explanation of the moment with an picture.

### Monday 3 March

Vandaag ben ik begonnen met het maken van mijn clock, ik gebruikte deze tijd om CSS nesting te leren en te experimenteren met Container Queries.
After 2 hours i got something like this.

And personaly I was unhappy with it. Constantly trying to fix it but with picture I used made it more difficult.

While it was a start i felt like I was going to far away from the origanal concept. So I went looking for an proper picture of the clock. With that picture I made an inspiration collage

### Monday 16 march

Taking inspiration from an fellow student wanted to try to make my clock 3d. I decided to follow the tutorial that was recomanded from Sanne. And I dind't undestand, and after trying mulitple tutorials.

So I decided to try with Chat gpt. (Not my proudest moment). It was able to make the box shape. I started with this so i could understand the cube making process.

So trying to convert the CSS to be able to without used without ID and CLASSES. And with the final result i created the cube CSS with just CSS nesting.

### Tuesday 17 march

Today I wanted to turn the cube into an rectangular shape. and adding pictures to the faces pictures and a clock shape. 

Turning the clock retangular is a little anoying but i by adjusting the postion of the left and right faces it was possible.

Adjusting the faces to show images was als possible using Style queries.

With this i can change the pages of the clock with button click and the position of the Clock to make it more interactive.

#### editor note image changing broke so i can't give imgs now
